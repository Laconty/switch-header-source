# switch-header-source package

Quick switching between C, C++, Objective-C, and Objective-C++ header and source
files...

...Actually between any arbitrarily defined groups of files (as long as you can match
their filenames with a regular expression)!

For example:

* Switch between `.C`, `.h`, and `.md` files (for implementation, headers, and
  class documentation files)
* Switch between `.js`, `.html`, and `.css` files
* Your imagination is the limit.. if not, [file an issue](https://github.com/dschwen/switch-header-source/issues)!

## Mac
Use ```Ctrl-Option-s``` to cycle though groups of matching files.

## Linux, Windows
Use ```Alt-o``` to alternate between a header and its corresponding source file.
